# DH110 
# Filing A Complaint and Tracking it: Department of Homeland Security Website
## Zia Khoshsirat

### Introduction

The coral intention of this project is to bring users' experience with the Department of Homeland Security website in finding the relevant formation about the travel [complaint]( https://www.dhs.gov/file-travel-complaint-dhs-trip) and specifically be able to easily track their complaint [status](https://trip.dhs.gov/TRIP/Home/CaseStatus). While the original website tried to keep the structure minimalistic and straightforward, it was not straightforward for some users with less technical knowledge to access the desired information. By deploying the users' experience with the website, this project provides alternative designs to facilitate users' efficient engagement with various elements of complaining and tracking pages. Thus, in this project, the design focuses on the issues addressed during the different stages of the project through (re-)modifying elements like changing shapes, fonts, alignments, and even re-designing a whole page. These stages will be discussed in the following sections. 


### Clear design statement: 

In this stage, this project intends to make navigation, finding, and tracking the complaint's status more accessible for users who might find the original design confusing. According to the feedback analyzed in this project, since the DHS is a vast section of the government, users might feel filing complaints and tracking it futile. This affective perspective would influence users’ engagement with the website, which is already confusing in its tracking section. 


### Competitor Analysis

In the heuristic evaluations stage, two websites, DHS ( [Department of Homeland Security]( https://www.dhs.gov/) ) and CBP ( [U.S. Custom and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) ) were tested to grasp a general idea about the structure of federal websites and scrutinize them for the later stages of this project. During the evaluation, issues like the contrast in Visibility of System Status and alignment in Aesthetic and Minimalist Design were noticed. However, the main issue (see Introduction) on which this project is focused was observed later.

### User research 
After the heuristic evaluations and testing of the website, it was time to see how users engage with the website and interact with different pages. Like the Usability Testing phase, users will be occupied with a particular activity such as browsing and filling forms to accomplish a task and gratify one’s need. Unlike Usability Testing, we are going to document users’ activity in the context. We are trying to observe users not merely as an entity that is not detached from the design; instead, the product is intentionally designed for them.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment 07]
Storytelling emplaces the subject matter in a context and takes the audience on a journey through the researcher’s eyes and the subject’s action. In my opinion, storytelling promotes subjects from mere users to persons with a life that affects their decision-making, rise and fall of feelings, and how they interact with an issue. Storytelling re-contextualizes the user and the product in their real-time entanglement.
