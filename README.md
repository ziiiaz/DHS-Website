# Department of Homeland Security Website
## Zia Khoshsirat

### Introduction
This project examines the filing complaint task on the Department of Homeland Security [website](https://www.dhs.gov/) and tries to resolve the issue of tracking the complaint status.  

### Clear design statement: 
Based on the interviews and feedbacks, we realized that some users are not able to find the status page quickly. 

### Competitor analysis [assignment 1 and 2]
In the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/ziiiaz/DH110---Week-1/blob/main/Week1.md#first-department-of-homeland-security), we found minor cosmetic and functional issues. However, we did not notice the issue that we have focused in this project.


### User research [contestual inquirt, assigment 04]
After the heuristic evaluations and testing of the website, it was time to see how users engage with the website and interact with different pages. Like the Usability Testing phase, users will be occupied with a particular activity such as browsing and filling forms to accomplish a task and gratify one’s need. Unlike Usability Testing, we are going to document users’ activity in the context. We are trying to observe users not merely as an entity that is not detached from the design; instead, the product is intentionally designed for them.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment 07]
Storytelling emplaces the subject matter in a context and takes the audience on a journey through the researcher’s eyes and the subject’s action. In my opinion, storytelling promotes subjects from mere users to persons with a life that affects their decision-making, rise and fall of feelings, and how they interact with an issue. Storytelling re-contextualizes the user and the product in their real-time entanglement.

### Wireframing and graphic design element variation [assigment 06 + part of 07]

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment 06)

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment 08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

### Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impressions test, accessability adit, usability testing; per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidence, I will notify you when you can make the content priae as soon as your work graded)
